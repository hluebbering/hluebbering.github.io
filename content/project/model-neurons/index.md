title: Mathematical Dynamics of Model Neurons 
subtitle: A Study By Wilson, H. R. and Cowan, J. D

summary: Studied neurons composed of excitatory and inhibitory subgroups, which each exhibited various oscillation patterns when fired.

# Study depicts a neuron population composed of excitatory and inhibitory subpopulations, exhibiting various oscillation patterns when fired.

# Study of the Wilson-Cowan model depicts a neuron population composed of an excitatory and inhibitory subpopulation. Both subgroups represent large-scale neurons that exhibit various oscillation patterns when fired.
