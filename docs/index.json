Tidy datasets are an organization in R that requires a structured format. The packageâ€™s tools save us time and effort in data wrangling and altering, and hence, help tidy up cluttered datasets into tidy datasets.\n\u0026nbsp;\nBase-List-Data-Frame \n CLICK HERE for full shiny tutorial\nThis module explains different types of columns in a data frame. An R list is a recursive vector: a data structure consisting of a collection of components. The components can be of different types (i.e., character, numeric) disguised as model objects, data frames, list-columns within data frames, and more.\n\u0026nbsp;\nUsing Tidyvsere to Manipulate Data\n CLICK HERE for full shiny tutorial\nThis study used a tidyverse software package called dplyr to process the data. Employing dplyrâ€™s basic data manipulation methods requires various functions. These functions include,\n  subset or filter() a data frameâ€™s observations by picking their values\n  choose variables or select() a data frameâ€™s columns\n  add or mutate() variables to a data frame\n  condense or summarize() variables down to a single paraphrase\n  \u0026nbsp;\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"4fedf626075f9116f5d52693604b8202","permalink":"https://hluebbering.github.io/project/learnr-study/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/learnr-study/","section":"project","summary":"Built and published interactive tutorials on using tidyverse for data analysis and generated randomized trials using shiny and learnr software.","tags":["Data Science"],"title":"Shiny and Learnr in Randomized Trials","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://hluebbering.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
